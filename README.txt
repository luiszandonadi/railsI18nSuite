RailsI18NSuite is a netbeans IDE plugin based in a netbeans platform 6.9.

Just install the plugin to see the Rails I18N Window work in the IDE.

Features: 

   * Read the yaml files in the RAILS_APP/config/locales/
   * deactivate the plugin if the main project is not of type RailsProject
   * Autocomplete the keys(just use ctrl + space to see root or .(dot) + ctrl + space to next key )
   * Include new key and value in the yaml file.
   * I18n to Portuguese(BR) and English(US)



TODO:
  * find all the yml files in a project.

Problems:
    SNAKEYAML not parse "order: [ :day, :month, :year ]" array, because it violates YAML syntax.



Just enjoy it!!!
